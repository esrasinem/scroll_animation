# scroll_animation

I built a scroll animation where sections of the website come into the frame. I created several content blocks such that each content box comes into view from alternating directions. I used CSS transitions to have the boxes come in smoothly, and I used JavaScript to tell where the trigger point is for the next box to come in. When the user scrolls up, it will remove the class when it hits the trigger point and the content box will slide out of view.
